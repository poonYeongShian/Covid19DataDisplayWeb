Retrospective Sprint 1
We think that the sprint could've been handled a bit better, because we all
have different timezones, so we had to find an optimal time to address issues quickly.
However, the team exhibited more actively compared to the previous weeks, hence we can 
roughly know the velocity of our work flow. We completed our tasks for the weeks which had 
a category that the client wanted which was the login page. We also created different
variations of the website to ask what preferred color the client wants. We've added
the signup page, loading animation and a snippet of the graphs to show our data for our
next iteration(this is to give the client an idea of the expectations of our next review).
Our main source of knowing what projects have been done or what was being done is from our Trello page.

Retrospective Sprint 2
As we enter Sprint 2, the team got to know each other better along with our working habits. In doing so,
we knew what to expect from each other and also how to delegate tasks based on the strength of each teammate.
We felt as a team, we've moved from the storming and norming stage into the Performing stage (Tuckman's model) 
and we did do much better as compared to the first sprint we've had. We've also had some minor issue regarding 
us under estimation and over estimating certain tasks in our user stories, despite us having played the planning 
poker to estimate each user story and story points. During our sprint phase, our team thought of some ideas of giving
the user better knowledge of the situation with Covid 19 and discussed it with the client, which gave us an understanding of
how to communicate with the client.
